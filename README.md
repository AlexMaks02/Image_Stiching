# Image Stitching
This project was developed for the Advanced Computer Vision course, focusing on stitching multiple images into a single panoramic image using MATLAB.

## Requirements
The following MATLAB toolboxes are required:
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Computer Vision Toolbox

## Data & Results

The goal is to stitch three images (left, center, and right) into a seamless panorama.
